        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <div id="originText">
            <p>Our humble story begins in a small village in Thailand in 1992. There, young 
            Chef Jav-a-Script nearly burnt down his entire village when he left some rice on the stove 
            and forgot about it as he played Mortal Kombat in his room. While he was able to beat the game
            and was crowned champion, he was mortified that he had put his village in such danger. From that
            day forward, Chef Jav-a-Script vowed to perfect his culinary skills, and honestly went a little
            overboard with it. Today, he lets no dish leave his kitchen that has not gotten his seal of 
            approval, which is hard to do because he has four restaurants. You will not find one single 
            grain of burned rice in your meal.
